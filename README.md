# Colorball
One ball, all color! Legend tells of a grey goey center, if only it could be cut open. Seriously though, the point of this is to make a better color scheme picker. Color has three parameters, so it should be presented in a 3D space. If a plane intersected the sphere, it would make a circle. This circle would look like a color wheel. By overlaying 2D geometric primitives on the wheel and taking the colors at the intersections of the edges, we would have opposite, triad, tetrad and other colorschemes. Another idea would be to have multiple planes intersecting the sphere and each other, and using three way intersection points to build a colorscheme. But all of this is theoretical right now, because all we have is a colorfull ball. I encourage anyone with an interest to fork the project and have fun with it. Hopefully we can merge forks into something amazing. For a sane starting point, I recommend the spinning-colorball-demo branch.

This project is based on the ThreeJS [vertex colors](http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_geometry_colors.html) demo.
